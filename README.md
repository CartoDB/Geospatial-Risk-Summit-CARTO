# Scaling climate risk analysis with CARTO
## Geospatial Risk Summit, 2025

Welcome to the **[Carto](https://carto.com/) Geospatial Risk Summit 2025** workshop! Our goal is to build a **real-time dashboard** that tracks the **number and value of assets** in areas impacted by climate risks, updated daily. This workshop will guide you through creating insights that help mitigate and understand these risks.

In this example, we are analysts working at a home insurance company, tasked with keeping our executives updated on potential climate-related claims on a day-by-day basis. 
- How many properties are currently in climate alert regions? 
- What is the Total Insured Value at risk?

Use the slides, worksheets, and data below to complete the exercise. 

At the end, we should have something that looks a little like this‚Ä¶ Explore [here](https://clausa.app.carto.com/map/1d3ff8eb-48dc-46f8-a1aa-41e8f85adb1b).
